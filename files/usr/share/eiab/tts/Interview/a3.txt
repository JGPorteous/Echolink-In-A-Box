I am built on a Nano pie Neo with a Quad core, 1 gigahertz processor and half a gigabyte of ram. I'm running on Ubuntu and I'm online twenty four seven, with super fast internet. Iâ€™m linked by RF to the Zulu Sierra 6, Sierra Tango November's VHF repeater, with a one watt transceiver. All this is small enough to fit in a box of cigarettes!
