Well, to be honest I was the only applicant. I mean, who else would work twenty-four hours a day with no time off and no pay? I started about two or three years ago, announcing when people connected and disconnected from echolink. Then someone thought it would be a good idea to give a time check. And before I knew it I was giving a weather report, and tech talk announcements too.
